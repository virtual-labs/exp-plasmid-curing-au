### About the Experiment 

Plasmid curing is a technique used to remove plasmids—extrachromosomal DNA elements—from bacterial cells. Plasmids often carry genes that confer advantageous traits, such as antibiotic resistance or metabolic capabilities. By eliminating these plasmids, researchers can determine whether specific phenotypic traits are plasmid-encoded. Acridine Orange, a DNA intercalating agent, is commonly used in this process due to its ability to interfere with plasmid replication without affecting chromosomal DNA. This experiment is fundamental in molecular biology for understanding gene function and the role of plasmids in bacterial adaptability.
